# Movies-ETL

** This project was meant to introduce us to learning how to extract, transform, and load large datasets. More specifically, a friend/client needed help creating an automated pipeline that brings in data and eventually loads it into existing dataframes.  This project used Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and MovieLens rating data for various movies. At the end of the analysis, we should be able to view all of the cleaned data in comprehendable and comparable chunks.
